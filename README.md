## General info
This project shows usage of proxy pattern.  
The main principle is to provide a placeholder for another object to control access to it.  
Proxy pattern is used to support resource-hungry objects, we do not want to instantiate such objects unless and until they are actually needed.  
In proxy pattern we define an object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world.
